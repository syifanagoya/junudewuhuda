But, she rarely makes appearances on her parents’ social media pages and has been kept out of the spotlight during her childhood. But now, Apple has turned 16 years old, and Paltrow surprised her fans this week by posting some stunning pics of the teen on Instagram and celebrating with a drive-by party.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m actually writing these words but … happy sweet sixteen my darling girl,” Paltrow wrote in the caption of the pics. “You are the light of my heart, you are pure joy. You are wickedly intelligent and you have the best, most dry, most brilliant sense of humor. I have the best time being your mom. I love our nightly evening chats when I really get to hear what’s on your mind.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CALoLIIjAoh/</p><p>The Goop founder continued her lengthy post by writing that Apple works hard to get whatever it is she wants to achieve, and she has “grit and responsibility in spades.” Paltrow considers herself to be “so damn lucky” that she is Apple’s mother, and described the 16-year-old as a beautiful and kind young woman.</p><p>Paltrow thanked her daughter for “choosing” her as her mother, and added that she adores her to the moon and back a zillion times. She also wrote that she was “sorry” Apple had to celebrate this particular birthday during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Paltrow is sure her daughter will find the best in everything, like she always does.</p><p>To celebrate Apple’s birthday in the middle of the lockdown, Paltrow hosted a drive-by party on Thursday and invited her friends to celebrate. Cameras caught Apple outside of her home and surrounded by colorful balloons as her friends stopped by to give her a hug. In addition to her friends, Apple’s younger brother Moses, 14, and her dad were also there for the party.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-_LHcxDdd8/</p><p>For fans who were wondering how Apple feels about her mom’s Goop lifestyle brand, she recently trolled her mom with her own interpretation of Paltrow’s quarantine to-do list. The actress posted a pic on her Instagram Story of Apple’s notebook where she had written: “Make more vagina eggs & candles.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Gwyneth Paltrow took Apple Martin’s criticism in stride, adding the hashtag #quaranteen to the post.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeXrMavsdOhZKmZnKm%2FsMOMnJ%2BroaNiuqK%2B06KlrGWUlsKotNOeqWaZoKW5pnnMmqmtoZ5iwba%2Bzaxkam5dlruledOhnLJlk5q5pq7RmqueZaeewal5w6ugr51dl8Zursirq6Gcka56sa3RrbBma2lsgHl%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
