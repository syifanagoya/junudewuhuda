And the look on his face was like — I looked at him and said, ‘Oh, she’s going to be the best female basketball player in the world.’ He was just so proud … So that’s really a tough one.”</p><p>He added, “My wife and I took [their deaths] … really tough. That’s all I’ll say on that. Just a great human being and [he] was in a great space in his life.”</p><p>Beyoncé, 38, previously paid tribute to Bryant and Gianna via Instagram by sharing throwback photos of the father-daughter duo. “I will continue to diligently pray for your Queens. You are deeply missed beloved Kobe,” she captioned a <a href=#>January 30 post</a>, referencing the late star’s wife, <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Bryant</strong></a>, and their other daughters, Natalia, 17, Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The January 26 crash <a href=#>took the lives of nine people</a>: Kobe; Gianna; pilot Ara Zobayan, 50; Gianna’s basketball teammates Alyssa Altobelli, 14, and Payton Chester, 13; Alyssa’s parents, John Altobelli, 56, and Keri Altobelli, 46; Payton’s mother, Sarah Chester, 45; and basketball coach Christina Mauser, 38.</p><p>Kobe and Vanessa, 37, had been married since April 2001.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmalix26%2BxJyYpaSjYrWqv4ylmKysXZi8r8LEq6qarJmku27DyK2fZqOfl7JurtGymKesXZeyp7vRnmSdnZGptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
