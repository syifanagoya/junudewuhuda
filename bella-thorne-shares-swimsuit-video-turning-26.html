In a new social media post, the actress shows off her amazing body in a purple swimsuit while ringing in another trip around the sun. "Turned 26 surrounded by the ocean, fresh air, and all the friends a girl could ask for. I'm feeling very lucky," she captioned the Instagram video. How does the beauty star fit and healthy? Celebwell rounded up some of her top lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_1649246530.jpg><p><span>Bella told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Allure</span></a><span> that fitness is a "family affair" for the Thornes. "I wouldn't say I'm in my best shape at the moment. My brother is my trainer," she said. She added to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hollywood Life</span></a><span> that she and her family exercise together, doing "yoga, some weight training, and a bit of boxing. It's a family affair at the moment!"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_2096835586.jpg><p><span>Bella focuses on strength and weight training and does very little cardio. "[My brother] has got me doing circuit training and weightlifting—I never do cardio. A lot of people think that cardio burns off weight better than weightlifting does…but weightlifting works your muscles, getting them toned while losing fat."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_201358139.jpg><p><span>Bella maintains that yoga is helpful in "helping her fall asleep easier at night," while also helping her feel like she "can do more in the day."&nbsp; According to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span>, yoga is a great workout. "Researchers found that people who practiced yoga for at least 30 minutes once a week for at least four years, gained less weight during middle adulthood," they said. "People who were overweight actually lost weight. Overall, those who practiced yoga had lower body mass indexes (BMIs) compared with those who did not practice yoga. Researchers attributed this to mindfulness. Mindful eating can lead to a more positive relationship with food and eating."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Bella focuses on keeping her plate clean and healthy, filling it with veggies, fruit, protein, smoothies, and even rice and pasta. "Rice, black beans, pasta, fruit for my smoothies, veggies and some protein," are just a few of the items she keeps on hand, she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hollywood Life</span></a><span>. During an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Wired</span></a><span>, she shared that she incorporates plant-based foods. "I'm not, I'm so sorry guys. I really want to be though," she said when asked if she was a vegan, adding that she eats&nbsp; "a lot of vegan food but man, bacon. Oh, gets me every time."</span></p><p><span></span><span>Bella doesn't look at the numbers on the scale anymore. "Almost every day I have been to the gym in the last 6 weeks. Turns out I only lost one poun</span><span>d of fat and gained one pound of muscle.. throw away your scales ladies because they don't mean shit. As long as YOU feel better and u like the way u look that's all that matters," she </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>tweeted</span></a><span> in 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKOxy6WYZqyYpL%2BvsYysn5qqlah6tMPIpqquoaRiw6qwxKhkra2io7avs4xrbWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
