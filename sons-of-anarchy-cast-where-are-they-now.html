His goal was to be as authentic to biker gangs as possible, which is why all of the actors learned to ride motorcycles and many did their own stunts.</p><p>“I want everyone to look like they live on those bikes,” Sutter told the<a href=#> Los Angeles Times</a> in September 2010. “These are cowboys, and those are their horses.”</p><p>SOA created a brotherhood among its cast from its inception, many of which remain close today. “This show has made us a real family,” Rossi told the L.A. Times in 2010.</p><p>Hunnam, for his part, has <a href=#>a tight bond with his former onscreen best friend</a>, Hurst. In March 2019, the <a href=#>Lost City of Z actor</a> admitted that he and the <a href=#>Remember the Titans</a> star briefly grew apart before solidifying their relationship.</p><p>“Ryan is one of my best friends,” Hunnam told <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter </a>at the time. “There were a couple years where I didn’t spend much time with Ryan, and then I got into a yoga practice that he has really devoted himself to in a very significant way. So, we now see each other very, very frequently at this Kundalini yoga studio that we both go to. He’s one of my dear friends.”</p><p>The majority of the cast, including <strong>Tommy Flanagan</strong> (who played Chibs) and <strong>Kim Coates</strong> (who played Tig), reunited the same year to celebrate <strong>Mark Boone Jr.</strong> (who played Bobby) and his wife, <strong>Christina Adshade</strong>’s wedding.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Bout last night’s summer solstice ✨♥️✨♥️ love love love♥️,” <a href=#><strong>Drea de Matteo</strong></a>, who played Jax’s first wife, Wendy, <a href=#>captioned a series of photos</a> from the June 2019 nuptials via Instagram.</p><p>Scroll down to see what the Sons of Anarchy cast has been doing since the show ended in 2014:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BovK%2B%2FjKidZpmelr%2BktNhmmpqrpGLEqbHRnmSaqpViwamx2GalqK9f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
