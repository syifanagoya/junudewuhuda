During an interview with <a href=#>Vogue</a> in June 2017, Zendaya revealed that her ex was her “first love” when reflecting on the heartbreak.</p><p>“It wasn’t a good ending,” she said at the time, noting that her former flame bought her a dog named Noon shortly before they called it quits. “You know you’re OK in a breakup when your first thought is not, ‘What did I do wrong?’ It’s, ‘That was the dumbest decision of your life, and you’re going to regret it forever.’”</p><p>The <a href=#>Malcolm & Marie star</a> addressed the breakup on her website the same year, detailing her step by step process for moving forward.</p><p>“I got rid of old text messages, pictures and their clothing I still had. You don’t hang on to old Band-Aids. Throw that in the trash! I tried my best to cut off communication. It was the best medicine for me,” <a href=#>she wrote</a>. “I started forcing myself to have a lot more fun. <a href=#>I tried new things</a> — going out and just doing more stuff. I dove into work and just started having more fun.”</p><p>The <a href=#>K.C. Undercover producer</a> added: “A healthy relationship does not mean you need to be with that person 24/7.”</p><p>The following year, the Greatest Showman actress told <a href=#><strong>Cardi B</strong></a> what she looks for in a partner while speaking with the rapper for <a href=#>CR Fashion Book</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Respect is my number one thing, and I think it shows in different ways,” Zendaya said in December 2018. “With anybody you’re with, you have to have a layer of respect, courtesy, understanding and tolerance. It’s also important to have somebody who makes you laugh. If someone can’t make me laugh, then that’s wack. And not just kind of laugh, but pee-my-pants laugh.”</p><p>Scroll down to see <a href=#>who Zendaya has been linked to</a> over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkx6a6w5qwmqtdma61tc2gZKGho6m8s8WMnKasrJGnwG6t06GjnqyVqHqiusNmpKiqlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
