Shania Twain, 57, has returned to being a brunette after a brief stint as a blonde and redhead.</strong></p><p>Saturday, at the 2023 BRIT Awards in London, England, the singer stood with brown hair on the red carpet. In addition, she wore a yellow dress with silver earrings, a necklace, and bracelets.</p><p>Shania attended the renowned award presentation, but she is not set to perform or appear. Most likely, the beauty is there to promote her new album, Queen of Me.</p><p>She was all smiles as she confidently smiled for the camera with yellow and black nail polish to match her clothing.</p><p>Last week, Shania attended an afterparty for the 2023 Grammy Awards before attending the BRITs. During her debut, her hair was long and bright red, and she wore another spectacular ensemble consisting of a black jumpsuit and black boots.</p><p>She also attended the real ceremony earlier that evening while wearing a black and white polka-dot sequined suit and a matching long hat.</p><p>Shania went blonde prior to the Grammys for a Republic Records function. She also displayed the new hairstyle during a taping of The Late Late Show with James Corden on the same day. In addition to the new hairstyle, she wore a silky orange dress.</p><p>However, Shania’s bright hair did not begin there. Last month, the singer of “That Don’t Impress Me Much” was spotted with pink hair.</p><p>She was promoting Queen of Me in New York City, New York when she wowed onlookers with her bubblegum appearance, which fans appeared to like. A long black leather coat and black leather boots completed the new look.</p><p>Shania has been experimenting with hair color since the September premiere of the music video for “Waking Up Dreaming.” She revealed to the BBC that she is a daydreamer who wishes to have fun with it. It’s all about escaping reality.</p><p>She remarked,</p><p><strong>“I’m definitely one of those daydreamers; it’s a lot more enjoyable to dream while awake and become the person you want to be.” “I desire to become a rockstar. I want to be Prince, Cyndi Lauper, and all of these wonderful, wacky, and fashionable things I’ve never done before.”</strong></p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/scott-thompson-top-on-body-enhancements-and-plastic-surgery-disasters/"}{"1":80}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Scott Thompson Top On Body Enhancements And Plastic Surgery Disasters</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Singer-Songwriter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Frida Röhl</a></h3>Frida Röhl estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
