His family left Yugoslavia in 1994 and moved to Brampton, Ontario, Canada, when Milos was 3 years old. His parents, Dušan and Vesna, are both engineers; Dušan has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, and Vesna earned degrees (including a master's) in computer engineering and mechanical engineering. Raonic has an older sister named Jelena and an older brother named Momir, and his uncle, Branimir Gvozdenović, was the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro. Milos speaks Serbian and English fluently. He attended tennis camp as a child, and after the family moved to Thornhill, Ontario, he took lessons with coach Casey Curtis at Richmond Hill's Blackmore Tennis Club, working with him "twice a day, almost every day, for the next nine years." Raonic attended Thornhill Elementary School and Thornhill Secondary School and graduated a year early. He moved to Montreal at age 16 and spent three years at Tennis Canada's National Tennis Centre.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>At age 12, Milos competed in his first International Tennis Federation (ITF)-sanctioned event, and two years later, he won his first singles match.

During his five years on the ITF Junior Circuit, Raonic's record was 53–30 in singles and 56–24 in doubles. Despite receiving several college scholarship offers, in 2008, Milos decided to instead focus on his professional tennis career while taking finance correspondence courses from Athabasca University. He turned professional in 2008 and played singles and doubles at ATP Challenger and ITF Futures tournaments. At ITF Futures tournaments in 2009 and 2010, he won four singles titles and five doubles titles, and in 2010, he played in the Canadian Open, US Open, Malaysian Open,&nbsp;and Japan Open.
