He is known for sticking to the traditional elements of country music and inspiring others to do the same. Strait has sold over 100 million records worldwide and has 13 multi-platinum albums, including “Pure Country,” which has sold 8 million copies. He is the 12th-best-selling artist in US history and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in the 2000s.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Career>Early Life and Career</span></h2><p>George Harvey Strait Junior Senior was born on May 18th of 1952 in Poteet, Texas. Raised on a cattle ranch in Pearsall, George developed a strong work ethic from a young age. His parents divorced when he was in grade four, and he turned to music during his high school days. He joined a rock ‘n roll band but soon fell in love with country music and attended live performances by country artists across Texas.</p><p>After high school, George joined the Army and was stationed in Hawaii. He joined an Army-sanctioned country band and welcomed his first child into the world with his wife, Norma. He served for four years and reached the rank of Corporal. After his honorable discharge, he pursued post-secondary education at Southwest Texas State University, eventually graduating with a degree in Agriculture.</p><h2><span id=George_Straits_Journey_to_Country_Music_Fame>George Strait’s Journey to Country Music Fame</span></h2><p>George Strait started his music career as part of a band called Stoney Ridge, which eventually became The Ace in the Hole Band. Despite opening for high-profile artists like the Texas Playboys, the group never took off, and George earned a living by working on his family’s ranch.</p><p>After being rejected by major record labels, George was finally offered a recording contract by MCA in 1981. His first single, “Unwound,” was a massive hit, climbing to number six on the country charts and prompting the release of his debut album, “Strait Country.” The album proved that traditional country sounds could still be popular in a modern era, as the genre was heavily shifting towards pop music.</p><p>George followed up with his second album, “Strait From the Heart,” in 1982 which featured his first number-one single, “Fool Hearted Memory.” After the tragic death of his daughter, George stopped doing interviews but continued to release numerous hits.</p><p>In 1990, George’s album “Livin’ It Up” showcased different sounds and received critical acclaim. He also starred in the film “Pure Country,” which was a commercial failure but the soundtrack became his most successful album.</p><p>George founded the George Strait Country Music Festival in 1997 and performed alongside some of the biggest names in country music. He continued to release successful albums with his tried-and-true country music formula, although 2000 marked a slight decline in sales with his self-titled album not reaching platinum status.</p><h2><span id=George_Straits_Personal_Life>George Strait’s Personal Life</span></h2><p>George Strait married his high school sweetheart Norma in 1971. They had two children together. However, their daughter died in a car accident in 1986, which led George to establish the Jenifer Lynn Strait Foundation, a children’s charity.</p><h2><span id=George_Straits_Brand_Partnerships>George Strait’s Brand Partnerships</span></h2><p>Country music icon George Strait has partnered with several prominent brands, including Wrangler Jeans, Justin Boots, Resistol, Garia, and Codigo Tequila. His collaboration with Wrangler Jeans is focused on supporting American veterans and their families through the National Patriot program. The program aims to raise funds for those who have been wounded in action or fallen while serving their country.</p><p>In addition to his partnership with Wrangler, Strait has also worked with Justin Boots and Resistol, two brands known for their cowboy-inspired apparel. He has also collaborated with Garia, a Danish luxury golf car manufacturer, and Codigo Tequila, a premium tequila brand.

He earned $99 million in just three years during the Strait Tours. Despite relatively few tour dates, he earned $15 million in 2005 with a tour that had only 18 shows.</p><p>In 2012, George announced that his Cowboy Rides Away tour would be his last. The tour was extremely successful, and he set a new record for the highest-grossing single-show concert with earnings of over $18 million after a single performance in Arlington.
