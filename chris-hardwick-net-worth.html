Over the next few years, he dated celebrities like <a href=# title="Andrea Savage Net Worth">Andrea Savage</a>, Janet Varney, and <a href=#>Chloe Dykstra</a>. After breaking up with Dykstra, he began a new relationship with model/actress/heiress <a href=#>Lydia Hearst</a>. Lydia's mother is <a href=#>Patty Hearst</a> and her great-grandfather is <a href=#>William Randolph Hearst</a>. In 2015, the pair became engaged, and in 2016 they were married.</p><h2 id=controversy><strong>Controversy</strong></h2><p>In 2018, Chris Hardwick's ex-girlfriend Chloe Dykstra published an essay claiming that she had been sexually abused by a former boyfriend. Although she didn't name any names, Dykstra stated that this ex-boyfriend was 20 years her senior, and that he was the CEO of his own company. The public put two and two together, and Hardwick was immediately embroiled in controversy. In a knee-jerk reaction, the Nerdist purged its website of any mention of Hardwick's name. AMC followed suit, canceling all future episodes of "Talking with Chris Hardwick" and dismissing Hardwick altogether.</p><p>Chris denied all of Dykstra's accusations, stating that he never sexually abused her. Three of Hardwick's ex-girlfriends and his wife also defended him, stating that they had never experienced anything like that from Chris. On the other hand, several figures anonymously stated that they were industry professionals and that they weren't surprised about the allegations.</p><p>TMZ then published text messages that were apparently sent between Hardwick and Dykstra in the days after their split. These messages apparently revealed that Dykstra had been unfaithful to him with another man known only as "Sam." Dykstra repeatedly expressed her desire to reconcile and get back together in these unvalidated messages.</p><p>Later in 2018, AMC announced that they had found no evidence to corroborate Dykstra's allegations, despite a lengthy investigation. As a result, Hardwick was reinstated with the network and he began to host podcasts again. Dykstra had refused to participate in the investigation for unknown reasons. The Nerdist also backtracked, and once again placed references to its founder on their website.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2015, it was reported that Chris Hardwick had purchased an estate in Los Feliz for $11 million. The property was built in 1928 with Italian design influences, and it originally hit the market for $12 million. The extensive, 8,240-square-foot house sits on about half an acre of land and features Corinthian columns, hand-carved ceilings, and a curving staircase.</p><p>In 2016, Hardwick sold a property in Hollywood Hills for $3.477 million in an off-market deal. The property features 5,100 square feet of living space, Venetian plaster walls, and an art studio. Terrace gardens and a Juliet balcony complete the impressive property. Chris originally listed the home for $4.05 million before relisting it for a lower price.</p><p>In 2018, he paid $5.25 million for a historic property in Los Angeles. Located in the neighborhood of Eagle Rock in the San Rafael Hills, the estate was built back in 1925 and is known as "Chateau Emanuel." It features 8,900 square feet of living space and sits on a 3-acre plot of land. The luxurious abode also boasts an incredible outdoor area with fountains, a pool, and a croquet court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqku8yem6KZnqh8pLTRoqpmoJGnsbi1wqRkp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
