With more people visiting every day, this article is intended to get you up to speed on everything you should be aware of before making the trip, including Table Mountain facts, activities, ticket prices, restaurants, hours of operation, and more.</p><h2>What can you do at Table Mountain?</h2><p class=align-left>You can <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">do the following things</a> at the park:</p><h3>Sightseeing</h3><p class=align-left>Take in the unique sights of Cape Town and the peninsula from the top. You can get a 360-degree view of the whole city from the top. To encourage this, there is a Sunset Special that pushes locals (i.e. South African citizens that must provide a valid form of ID) to watch the sunset by slashing ticket prices in half after 6:00 pm.</p><h3>Photography</h3><p class=align-left>The unique sights make the place perfect for photography. Bring your professional or amateur equipment and see what kind of Table Mountain pictures you can get.</p><h3>Cable car tour</h3><p class=align-left>The Table Mountain cable car that takes visitors up to the peak is very popular with tourists. The trip to the peak, 1,089 metres above Cape Town, takes 5 minutes and is wheelchair-accessible.</p><h3>Hiking</h3><p class=align-left>You do not have to take the cable car to the top, and you can just hike your way up there. A Table Mountain hike is a great exercise if you take the 600-metre path from Tafelberg Road to the top.</p><h3>Biking</h3><p class=align-left>Apart from hiking, you can grab a bicycle and ride your way up there. It is also a great exercise on its own with the Table Mountain height.</p><h3>Abseiling</h3><p class=align-left>Another sport available to visitors is abseiling, also referred to as rappelling. In this extreme sport, you rope down the sides of the cliff for excitement and adventure. The activity is managed by Abseil Africa.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Lion and Safari Park latest fees, operating hours, events, animals, photos, contact details</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7f8fddc693024446.jpg><h3>Guided walks</h3><p class=align-left>You can go on a walk with a tour guide that will tell you the story of the attraction.
