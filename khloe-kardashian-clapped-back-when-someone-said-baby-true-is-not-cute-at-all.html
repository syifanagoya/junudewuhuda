All of the Kardashian-Jenner daughters were born within a few months of each other – True, Stormi, Chicago – and it will be interesting to see how the cousins will grow up together and possibly grow up to look like each other. I know that the Kardashian-Jenners live to put their lives on social media and that everything is an angle with them, but I enjoy the fact that they’re sharing photos of the babies and everything. People ARE interested. But that doesn’t mean you should tag Khloe with your opinions about her baby. That’s what someone did a few days ago – a person tweeted at Khloe, saying that Baby True is “not cute at all.” That’s so f–king rude. Khloe thought so too:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>What self-respecting adult would even comment on a child’s appearance? What type of disgusting human being are you? It’s pathetic that you are this miserable in your life</p><p>— Khloé (@khloekardashian) <a href=#>July 7, 2018</a></p><p>Then Khloe raised the point about tagging her in that opinion:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>She’s a loser for that. No respect for people like that. People are entitled to their own opinions and feelings but why on earth would you tweet that and if you must why would you tag me?</p><p>— Khloé (@khloekardashian) <a href=#>July 7, 2018</a></p><p>That’s what I don’t understand – why in God’s name would you tweet @ Khloe just to insult her baby? One, stop insulting babies. WHO DOES THAT. And two, if you really, really have to insult a baby, for goodness sake, don’t tag the baby’s mother in your tweet.</p><p>Khloe wasn’t done with <a href=#>the clapbacks</a>, although this one was a bit funnier. Someone else tagged her with the opinion that she was holding Tristan hostage after he cheated on her and “Just put him on an ankle monitor sis.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you are corny enough to believe something like this than you must have a very miserable and boring life. The fact that you felt the need to tweet me this already sheds light onto the kind of life you have <a href=#>https://t.co/KZzw0T8gUP</a></p><p>— Khloé (@khloekardashian) <a href=#>July 7, 2018</a></p><p>In this case, I just think it’s a little bit funny that Khloe jumped down this person’s throat for saying that that sis needs to put an ankle monitor on Tristan. Because… I mean, she should do that. But Khloe is trying to present this happy-family image and it’s all going to blow up in her face and no one is going to be sympathetic towards her when it does happen. Because she’ll have spent months blowing up at people for offering reasonable advice about ankle monitors. Maybe I should tweet @ Khloe with my idea for a d-ck lojack.</p><p>Photos courtesy of Instagram.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbnBjbn55e8qho6idj6Cus7DArJ%2BimZ6UsK2tz6mcnZeSlrCsq9ahnKeXo6S6prvNnpasmZmZrKOtwbKWraqlmqyqv76npq2Xk6rBpqvArZaapJxk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
