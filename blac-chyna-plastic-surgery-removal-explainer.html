The ex-girlfriend of <a class=hm-link href=#>Rob Kardashian</a> has taken to Instagram to document the whole process and discuss the dangers of her procedures with professionals.</p><p id=ergnC2PPJi5 data-wc=49>Numerous celebrities have decided it’s time to be the most authentic version of themselves over recent months, including <a class=hm-link href=#>Pamela Anderson</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Paris Hilton</a>. Now Chyna – whose real name is Angela White – has decided: “Enough is enough. It all has to come out, it’s as simple as that”.</p><p id=ebzoeG8dDf data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Surrogacy: What the new UK law changes could mean for you</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ecpU--FaYF data-wc=12><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Would you try a non-surgical bum lift? Here’s our honest review</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ebh87zpVpex data-wc=49>So far she has documented surgery visits to have her breast implants, silicone butt injections and facial fillers removed. She explained to her surgeon in a video “I’m just tired of the look, it’s just not flattering. It’s not what I look like and it totally changed my face”.&nbsp;</p><p id=eGIXDF2k6cB data-wc=26>The 34-year-old also said she has outgrown her persona Blac Chyna: “I feel like it’s time for a change. I’m ready to get back to Angela”.</p><p id=ehvWDCYqlTX data-wc=58>Award-winning Harley Street aesthetics doctor, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Dr Sophie Shotter</a>, said that this is a common reason for people having their surgery reversed. “Blac Chyna had what I would call an ‘over-defined look’ through her use of facial fillers. She clearly became aware of that - either through her own insight, or because someone had a frank conversation with her.”</p><p id=e255JBKmQL9 data-wc=40>Numerous celebrities have had fillers removed over recent years, including Courtney Cox, Khloe Kardashian and Victoria Beckham. Beckham told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>British Vogue</a> in 2017 that she’d tell her younger self: "Don't mess with your boobs ... just celebrate what you've got.”</p><p id=eYoLP3vqIm- data-wc=47>“People seeking reversal are those who have ended up with looks which are not congruent with what they want now - that may be because of a change in their own aesthetic ideals, or because they’ve realised they had taken the transformation too far,” Dr Shotter continues.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Blac Chyna’s dermal fillers</strong></h2><p id=evUh7Kvb2wAO data-wc=36>Chyna had facial filler in her cheeks, jaw and lips. Dr Shotter says these were most likely made of hyaluronic acid which is manipulated in a laboratory to turn it into a gel with lifting capacity.</p><p id=evWI78oEdr-r data-wc=46>For the removal process: “We would inject a substance called Hyaluronidase (the exact forms of this may be different between the USA and the UK due to product licensing). Hyaluronidase is an enzyme which our bodies produce to break down our natural hyaluronic acid.” she explains.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2Vxlo0r5dmw data-wc=66>“When dissolving fillers we inject this solution into the areas where we want to break filler down. This process usually works over a period of a few hours, although it can take a few weeks to appreciate the final result. The hyaluronidase will also remove some of the body’s natural hyaluronic acid in the area injected, and this can take a month to fully replenish itself.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eYUBW0EEOu data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Pamela Anderson stuns in her signature 90s style for Pamela: A Love Story documentary premiere</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Blac Chyna’s tattoos</strong></h2><p id=eKWydUA1MahJ data-wc=44>Blac Chyna, who is mum to 10-year-old King Cairo with Tyga and six-year-old Dream with Rob Kardashian, said she was having her tattoo of Baphomet removed because of its ‘demonic’ connotations. The mythical goat headed creature is believed to be an alias of Satan.</p><p id=eLPNpTnCWAIi data-wc=41>Dr Shotter explained lasers are used to remove tattoos which target the pigment in the ink. “The laser then hits the pigment particles then breaks them into tiny particles, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream and removed from the body”.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>&nbsp;Black Chyna’s silicone butt injections</strong></h2><p id=eIzjp5PNK2iQ data-wc=73>Aside from documenting her spiritual awakening, Chyna also warned fans through her videos of the dangers of some of her procedures. She clarified that her buttock injections were totally different to a BBL. “By the way, [butt] shots and a BBL are totally different. A BBL is when they use your own fat, [butt] shots are silicone. So I just want all the ladies out there to know: do not get silicone shots.”</p><p id=exkiwQyUIzsZ data-wc=35>Cosmetic Surgeon and founder of Cosmedics Skin surgery, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Dr Ross Perry</a>, explained the risk of these procedures: “Silicone injections are the worst treatment of the above. Poor results, scarring, granuloma and cyst formations and pain.”</p><p id=ez7-hd2hZQWo data-wc=30>“Surgery to remove is the only option," he continues. “It is also risky due to chances of infection, bleeding and will often leave an irregular contour, potentially months of pain.”</p><p id=eM1ago0o_6 data-wc=10><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Paris Hilton serves 'stylish royal' in Kate Middleton-approved brand&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How safe are BBLs?</strong></h2><p id=eqZ7AWlutbsA data-wc=61>“A BBL in any form is a high risk procedure whether done with fat injections, fillers injections or silicone implants,” explains Dr Perry. “The main risk is an embolus or clot going into the bloodstream and causing a stroke or heart attack. Other major risks are necrosis of the skin (ie skin death) infection, irregularity, chronic pain to name a few.”</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Blac Chyna’s breast reduction</strong></h2><p id=evEo94dciViK data-wc=36>Chyna told fans that her breast reduction surgery was the fifth time she’d had work done on her chest, and she hopes it will be her last. “I’m past that stage, I’ve been there done that”</p><p id=ehHtBRsjgBqI data-wc=27>Dr Perry explained: “Breast reduction is a common procedure done where the breasts are pendulous or heavy, causing neck and or back pain or aesthetically too uncomfortable.</p><p id=edw2GsNcY-Rv data-wc=22>"It is done under general anaesthetic and the amount of tissue removed is discussed at the consultation to achieve the best outcome.”&nbsp;</p><p id=esdwHVgvJz data-wc=11>Find out more from Dr Shotter <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>www.drsophieshotter.com</a> and Dr Perry: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.cosmedics.co.uk/doctors-surgeons/dr-ross-perry/</a><br></p><p id=e9qYzZcTvs data-wc=21><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
