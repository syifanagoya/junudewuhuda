The pair of violations have accrued a balance of $1,140, according to the outlet.</p><p>The news of Spears’ alleged infractions comes after the Ventura County sheriffs <a href=#>performed a wellness check</a> on the pop star that same month. Spears was visited by the police after a video of herself <a href=#>dancing with a set of knives</a> was reported to the authorities. She later assured her fans that <a href=#>the cutlery wasn’t real</a>.</p><p>“I know I spooked everyone with the last post, but these are fake knives that my team rented from Hand Prop shop in LA,” Spears wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in September alongside another clip of her performing with the props. “These are not real knives. No one needs to worry or call the police. I’m trying to imitate one of my favorite performers Shakira … a performance I was inspired by !!! Cheers to us bad girls who aren’t afraid to push boundaries and take risks 💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-fined-for-driving-without-her-license-and-proof-of-insurance-01.jpg><p>The concern for Spears’ wellbeing comes amid her divorce from estranged husband <a href=#><strong>Sam Asghari</strong></a>. Us confirmed in August that <a href=#>the pair had separated</a> after less than one year of marriage. Asghari, 29, <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> that same day and cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split. (Before tying the knot in 2021, Spears and Asghari <a href=#>began their romance</a> in 2016.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Some people are of the opinion that Britney’s on a dangerous downward spiral,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> in August. “And the stuff she’s been [doing] hasn’t done much to dampen that worry. The concern for Britney’s welfare right now is off the charts.”</p><p>This is the first time Spears has navigated life on her own since her <a href=#>13-year conservatorship</a> was terminated in November 2021. In 2008, Spears was put under a conservatorship following a series of personal struggles. Her father, <a href=#><strong>Jamie Spears</strong></a>, had control over her estate. In the heated hearings, Britney claimed that<a href=#> she felt “enslaved” by her father</a> and also called out her mother<a href=#><strong> Lynne Spears</strong></a> and sister <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lynn Spears</strong></a> for allegedly <a href=#>not “doing anything” to help her</a>.</p><p>While Britney’s inner circle continues to worry about the singer, a second insider exclusively told Us that she has been busy “focusing on herself” as she <a href=#>works on new music</a> and prepares for the release of her upcoming <a href=#>memoir</a>, The Woman in Me, which drops on October 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpu6bFjKynnpmiqHqntc2em2aen6d6pb7Ir6Cnn12strW0zq6rZqSZmLKvv8RmmKecXZ67tMHRmqWcnV2nsrG70a1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
