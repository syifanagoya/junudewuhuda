A Look into the Life of a Fashion Icon</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Karl Otto Lagerfeld was a German fashion designer, creative director, artist, and photographer. He was born in September 1933 and pἀssed away on February 19, 2019.</p><p>Lagerfeld entered the fashion industry in the 1950s and has since worked for Balmain, Patou, and Chloé in addition to joining Chanel in 1983. From 1983 until his deἀth in 2001, he served as Chanel’s creative director, a position in which he was responsible for all of the company’s artistic endeavors.</p><p>He had a crucial role in reviving the Chanel name and restoring the company to its former prominence as a global leader in the fashion industry.

His maternal grandfather, Karl Bahlmann, was a local politician for the Catholic Centre Party, and his father owned a business that produced and imported evaporated milk.</p><p>Lagerfeld frequently lied about his age and family history, even saying he was born in a different year. He said his parents were “Elisabeth of Germany” and “Otto Ludwig Lagerfeldt” from Sweden, and that he was born in 1938. These rumors have been debunked once and for all by the fact that his father was born and raised in Germany, not Sweden.</p><p>Elisabeth Bahlmann, his mother, was the daughter of a middle-class local politician, but there is no evidence that she ever identified as “Elisabeth of Germany.” He always claimed that nobody knew his actual birthday. Lagerfeld said he was born “neither in 1933 nor 1938” during a television interview in France in February 2009.</p><p><strong>You can also take a look at other celebrities personal life details we have provided in below links:</strong></p><h2>Karl Lagerfeld Controversies</h2><p>Lagerfeld’s career was marked by numerous controversies, including accusations that he was fatphobic, anti-Islam, and opposed the Me Too movement. Despite apologies from the designer and the fashion brand, Lagerfeld’s inclusion of a phrase from the Qur’an in his spring 1994 couture collection for Chanel caused great controversy.</p><p>The Indonesian Muslim Scholars Council in Jakarta threatened to register formal protests with the government of Lagerfeld’s native Germany after the 1994 couture presentation in Paris.

Furthermore, De Bascher had an affair with couturier Yves Saint-Laurent, prompting Saint-Laurent’s former lover and business partner Pierre Bergé to accuse Lagerfeld of plotting to bring down the rival fashion house. Lagerfeld stayed on a cot by De Bascher’s side in the hospital room where he died from AIDS in 1989.</p><p>Tabloids said that after Lagerfeld’s deἀth, his ash*s were going to be combined with those of de Bascher and his mother’s urn.</p><p>If you want to check out more articles like this then you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdganxxfo6wn6hlmah6rK3RpWSlmZeav6exy51m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
