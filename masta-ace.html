He was born Duval Clear, he is an American rapper who had a string of radio hits in the late 1990’s, including “Born to Roll” and “Crooklyn”.</p><p><a href=#>Eminem</a> mentions him as one of his influences in his book ‘The Way I Am’.&nbsp;has him listed among his sources of inspiration in his book , ‘The way I’m Behaving’.</p><p>Clear graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1988, after meeting Marley Marl in 1987 during his summer break. Ace made his recording debut on the Juice Crew posse-cut “The Symphony”, along with fellow Juice Crew members Craig G, Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane, released on Marley Marl’s In Control album. The album also featured two additional Ace tracks, “Keep Your Eyes on the Prize” and “Simon Says”. In 1989, he released his first solo single, “Together” b/w “Letter to the Better”. His debut album, Take a Look Around, was released through Marl’s Cold Chillin’ label in 1990, featuring production from Marl and DJ Mister Cee. The album featured two minor hit singles in “Music Man” and “Me & The Biz”, the latter track including Ace impersonating Biz Markie who did not reach the studio for the planned duet.</p><p>During the years between his debut and his second album, Ace began having bitter feelings toward the commercial state of hip hop music, as well as the prominence of Gangsta rap, feelings which ruled the content on his second release, 1993’s SlaughtaHouse, with the loose concept of the album seeing Ace taking the fake “gangsta emcees” to his “SlaughtaHouse”. The album featured Ace’s new crew, Masta Ace Incorporated, which included Eyceurokk, Lord Digga, Paula Perry and R&B vocalist Leschea. The singles “SlaughtaHouse”, “Saturday Nite Live”, “Style Wars” and “Jeep Ass Niguh” were taken from the album. The latter featured an unlisted remix titled “Born to Roll”, which became a crossover single in 1994, peaking at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In the same year, Ace became a member of a temporary crew Crooklyn Dodgers, formed for the release of Spike Lee’s movie, Crooklyn, along with MC’s Special Ed and Buckshot of Black Moon, and recorded the title track of the album soundtrack. The song became Ace’s second Hot 100 hit in 1994, peaking at #60 on the chart.</p><p align=justify>The album “MA DOOM: Son Of Yvonne” is about his mother who died. in her death.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Masta Ace</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Masta</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ace</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brooklyn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Yvonne Clear</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Masta Ace ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

JCOR Records folded soon after the release, leaving it out-of-print, until being re-released in 2005 on Ace’s self-established M3 label. The album closer, “No Regrets”, led many fans to believe that it would be Ace’s final album, because of the line “I don’t know if it’s the end, but yo, it might be”. Ace killed the rumors by returning in 2004 with his fifth album A Long Hot Summer, another highly acclaimed effort. The story concept, similar to that on his last release, served as a prelude to the story told on Disposable Arts, chronicling the “Long Hot Summer” that led to his character’s incarceration at the beginning of the Disposable Arts album. Rumors once again spread about a retirement, which were again squashed, when Ace announced the formation of his new rap crew named eMC, including himself, Punchline, Wordsworth and his protégé Strick. Ace remarked in a December 2006 interview that he would no longer record as a solo artist, only with eMC. eMC’s first group album, The Show, was scheduled for early 2007 but was released in February 2008 digitally and April 2008 physically.</p><h2>Masta Ace Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Masta Ace is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United States.
