Adam DeVine has been at it since 1995 when he began his career, and he’s been making waves ever since. He’s an exceptionally hilarious individual, and we love him as Andy on Modern Fam. His career includes dozens of hit guest appearances, shows and appearances, and he’s not losing any momentum as he gets a little bit older. He’s been in the headlines for more than 20 years now and his career is hotter than ever. Adam DeVine is just a funny guy, and that makes us wonder a bit about him. Comedians are funny, but are they always funny? Are they as hilarious in their private lives as they are in their personal lives, or do they save their best stuff for their professional lives? We don’t actually know for certain, but we do know that <a href=#>Adam DeVine</a> has a Twitter page, and we can use that to get a glimpse into his life and into his mind. So, is he as funny on the internet as he is in life?</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hide yo kids! Hide yo wives! WORKAHOLICS WORKAHOLICS WORKAHOLICS WORKAHOLICS! Tonight!!!!!!</p><p>— ADAMDEVINE (@ADAMDEVINE) <a href=#>February 11, 2015</a></p><p>What we love about Adam DeVine is that he’s never afraid to say what’s really on his mind. And he seems to really have a thing for Workaholics. Who can blame him, though?</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>That being said. I'll def come to Omaha and eat Runza's and drink beer and do stand up ASAP!</p><p>— ADAMDEVINE (@ADAMDEVINE) <a href=#>January 27, 2015</a></p><p>It doesn’t sound like the worst way to work, to be honest. Actually, maybe more employers should ask their employees to work like this. They might get a little more productivity out of them.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I do not care that Lebron is playing in Cleveland. <a href=#>@blakegriffin32</a> and <a href=#>@CP3</a> are playing in LA.
