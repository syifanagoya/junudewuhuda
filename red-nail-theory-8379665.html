A recent example of the social machine’s prowess? Red nail theory. From meticulously curated “cores” to trend-defining <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup palettes</a>, TikTokers can turn even the most classic beauty looks (ahem, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>red manicure</a>) into viral sensations that feel fresh and conversation-worthy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Red nail theory</a> revamps the idea of the timeless red manicure into a vehicle for instant attention—perhaps even of the romantic variety. If you’ve ever experienced the self-assuredness (and the double-takes) that comes when you incorporate red into your makeup or wardrobe, you’ve already done a bit of case testing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But what exactly is red nail theory—and does it really work? Experts help us break it down.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink

Origins</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Red nail theory cropped up in early 2022 when public relations expert and creator&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Robyn Delmonte</a>&nbsp;noticed the effect and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>took to TikTok to coin it</a>. “I know guys are attracted to red nails, and I’ll tell you why,” Delmonte asserts, gesticulating with her cherry-red manicure. “Every time I have red nails [...] a guy comments on it.” She postulates that the positive association comes from ‘90s beauty norms and the fact that many of the era’s female caretakers rocked the red.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eiseman agrees with the hypothesis. “Much of color association starts in childhood,” she explains. “It is a logical conclusion that men would be attracted to red nail polish as a reminder of the colors their mothers wore on their nails at a significant time when they were strongly connected and dependent.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, the trend has taken on a life of its own, with TikTokers painting nails in the most fiery shades while discussing the theory and reporting results.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme

id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use Red Nail Theory</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first step of red nail theory involves adopting an appropriate manicure.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Red nails are great because there are so many different shades and undertones that can be paired with any skin tone or personal preference,” says&nbsp;Hanna. “Red nails are truly timeless and chic.”</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Hanna's Go-To Red Polishes</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, as Eisman notes, there’s no reason to relegate the powers of red to nails alone.&nbsp;“The use of red in other areas, obviously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>on the lips</a>, or in items of clothing, are equal attention-getters.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-does-red-nail-theory-actually-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Does Red Nail Theory Actually Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Associations with red can be culturally significant, thereby evoking specific emotions and perceptions,” says&nbsp;Dr. Yusim. “Red is often associated with love, romance, and passion in many cultures.” She adds that red is the color of blood, which calls to mind vitality and energy—and that all of these associations can, indeed, subconsciously influence how individuals perceive someone wearing red nail polish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think that the red nail theory is a real thing because psychologically, we associate red with passion, love, and power,” says Hanna. “While it’s not necessarily scientifically proven that red nails are attractive, it often makes you appear more confident and alluring.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The shade holds an equally powerful position when it occurs naturally, further proving the theory’s broader point.&nbsp;“Red is mother nature’s signal color—think of hummingbirds and their attraction to red,” says Eiseman. “It is a dynamic color that is impossible to ignore.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Benefits and Limitations</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of the truth of the theory, red nail polish offers a quick confidence boost. “Wearing red nail polish can be seen as a form of confident self-expression, showing that one is not afraid to stand out and be noticed,”&nbsp;says Dr. Yusim. “Confidence can contribute to attractiveness: when individuals feel confident and comfortable in their own skin, it can make them more appealing to others.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, there’s absolutely no guarantee that the red-nail reaction is a universal one—and that initial attention can only get us so far.&nbsp;“Individual preferences of what is attractive versus not vary widely, and it's important to remember that personal qualities and interactions play a significant role in attracting others, rather than solely relying on the color of nail polish,” says Dr. Yusim.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-controversies-and-criticisms></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Controversies and Criticisms</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2008 study</a>&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;Journal of Personality & Social Psychology&nbsp;found that red, relative to other achromatic and chromatic colors, led men to view women as more attractive and sexually desirable—and that men were unaware of the effect. But while wearing red on your nails may succeed in getting a human being’s attention, this likely has more to do with the bold nature of the color (and that association’s effects on both parties) and less to do with said human’s mom or other past matriarchal figures.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Ultimately, feeling confident and comfortable in your own skin, expressing yourself authentically, and cultivating positive personal qualities are likely to have a more significant impact on attracting others than the specific color of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nail polish</a> you choose,” says Dr. Yusim. She adds that an individual’s associations with colors—as well as their experience with past caretakers, again the crux of the original theory—varies widely and cannot be counted on as universal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570Z6bZqaRnrluwMeepquxXW2AeIWVb2w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
