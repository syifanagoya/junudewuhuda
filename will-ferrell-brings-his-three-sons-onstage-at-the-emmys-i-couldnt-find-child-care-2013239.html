The funnyman — and dad of three! — took to the stage to close out the Emmys on Sunday, Sept. 22, and brought out the biggest laughs of the night from the audience by trekking onstage in nothing but an old T-shirt, shorts and <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a>.</p><p>"It is indeed an honor to be presenting the last two awards of the evening: best comedy series and best drama series," he began his speech as his three sons with wife <strong>Viveca Paulin</strong> — <strong>Magnus</strong>, 9, <strong>Mattias</strong>, 6, and <strong>Axel</strong>, 3 — stood by dad in soccer uniforms and <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>. Axel wore rainboots and clung onto an oversized blanket.</p><p>"What? No, you cannot play Angry Birds right now," he admonished Magnus as the audience cracked up. A pan to <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tina Fey</strong></a> showed the comedienne doubling over in laughter.&nbsp;</p><p>Ferrell, 46, jokingly explained that <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Helen Mirren</strong></a> and <strong>Maggie Smith</strong> had dropped out of their presenting duties "literally 45 minutes ago" and the actor had to bring the kids along because he "couldn't find child care, OK?"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"We had a soccer game, there was a neighbor's birthday party, a nut allergy," he listed off. "I didn't have time to do my hair! It doesn't matter, it's great to be here."</p><p>After presenting the best comedy series to Modern Family — creator <strong>Steven Levitan</strong> called the win "surreal" — Ferrell went back to scolding his sons before presenting the last award of the night.</p><p>"You have to go to the bathroom?! I asked you backstage if you had to go to the bathroom," he said. "So you're just going to have to hold it. This is the Emmys. Don't blow this for me!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaK6ipJxis6a%2B0Z6jpWWSp7avs9Jmn6KrXam1s7HEZqqopqNivK%2B%2F05qenmWRqXq1tMRmnKalqah6qnnCqKylnJ6peqe1zZ1knKCZobFur8CrnGZqYGaAc3%2BY</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
