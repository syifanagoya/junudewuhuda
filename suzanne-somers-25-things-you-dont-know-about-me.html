That seems simple, but you’d be amazed at how many <a href=#>couples don’t remember to give one another a lot of attention</a>,” the Bullitt actress exclusively told Us in January 2021. “It’s not, like, a chore for us. I love to hug him and rub his hair. He tells me I’m beautiful all the time and we hold hands while we sleep. It’s the most beautiful part of my life.”</p><p>Somers added that she and the former Anniversary Game host <a href=#>will sometimes hold hands “all night” long</a>. “I’ll wake up and we’re holding hands all the time!” she said.</p><p>The California native and Hamel also <a href=#>do their best to keep their relationship spicy with regular date nights</a> whenever possible. “We date every night. I think dates are really important, especially [in] long-term marriages,” Somers explained in January 2021. “So, here’s a date — it’s 5 o’clock and that’s when I stop working and he stops working, or if I do a Facebook Live show, I go to work from 5 to 6. But on the nights that I don’t do Facebook Live, we meet at Big Al’s bar — that’s the bar at our house — and he pours me a stiff tequila of clear because clear has little to no sugar and a lot of ice.”</p><p>She continued: “We sip tequila, listen to music, sometimes we dance. … It’s just what we do.”</p><p>Somers gushed that she is “madly in love” with her husband, and has been “for [more than] 50 years.”</p><p>It’s not just the former sitcom star who does her best to keep things interesting. In February 2020, Somers revealed that <a href=#>the Canda native performed a strip tease for her</a> as his Valentine’s Day gift. “This is what you call an 83 year old STRIP TEASE!” she wrote via Instagram at the time, <a href=#>alongside a video from the goofy moment</a>. “How lucky am I to have Alan as my Valentine!? Happy Valentine’s Day to all of you from my #weirdassfamily! LOVE IS ALL THERE IS! ❤️”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Somers:</p><p>1.
