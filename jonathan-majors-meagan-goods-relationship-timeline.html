Franklin filed the paperwork in late 2021, and the duo finalized their split nearly one year later. In a joint statement, Good and Franklin <a href=#>addressed their decision</a> to part ways.</p><p>“After much prayer and consideration, we have decided to go into our futures separately but forever connected. We celebrate almost a decade of marriage together and a love that is eternal. There’s no one at fault, we believe this is the next best chapter in the evolution of our love,” read their December 2021 statement. “We are incredibly grateful for the life-changing years we’ve spent together as husband and wife. We are also extremely thankful to God for the testimony being created inside us both and for blessing our lives with each other.”</p><p>Majors, meanwhile, remained largely tight-lipped about his personal life <a href=#>until he was arrested</a> following an alleged domestic violence dispute. In March 2023, Majors was identified as the aggressor in the incident, according to a report by the New York Police Department.</p><p>The former Marvel actor was released after several hours in police custody and has continued to deny the allegations. Days after his arrest, Majors was arraigned and charged with assault and harassment. He filed a countersuit against the alleged victim, <a href=#>his ex-girlfriend <strong>Grace Jabbari</strong></a>, three months later, claiming Jabbari caused him pain and made him bleed during the March 2023 incident.</p><p>As Majors prepared for his trial, the actor took his romance with Good public. The pair were spotted on various outings after news broke about his legal issues, and Good remained by Majors’ side in the courtroom. He was <a href=#>ultimately found guilty of assault</a> in the third degree and harassment in December 2023. The jury also found Majors not guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look at Majors and Good’s relationship timeline:</p><h3>May 2023</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jonathan-Majors-and-Meagan-Goods-Relationship-Timeline-2.jpg><p>The duo sparked romance rumors after they were photographed on a movie date.
