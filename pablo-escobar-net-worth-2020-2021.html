He was one of the seven children of the couple.</p><p>His educational background is not well known though its reported he briefly went to university but dropped out.

He could steal gravestones, sell counterfeit university diplomas, steal cars, sell fake lottery tickets, and contraband smuggler.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Pablo has been documented to have two relationships, one with the mother of his two kids Maria Victoria Henao and the other woman Griselda Blanco.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 1 December 1949, Pablo Escobar was 44 years old at the time of his death. His height was 1.67 m tall and weigh 75 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Pablo graduated from being a petty criminal who used to kidnap and earn $100,000 to a cocaine distributor. He used to fly planes that smuggled cocaine from Colombia to Panama. He had a fleet of more than 20 planes and more than ten helicopters for the job. He went to drug business because it was an untapped territory. Each plane per flight would bring home around $500k.</p><p>As the demand for cocaine increased in the USA Escobar and co-founder of cartel Carlos Lehder increased his smuggling routes such as the Bahamas. Its estimated that around 70 and 80 tons of cocaine were being shipped every month to the united states. When he was elected as a member at the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia, his Medellin cartel increased the distribution to countries such as pain, Mexico, Venezuela, and continents such as Asia and Europe.</p><p>Escobar was to be extradited to the united states together with others through a court process, and before that would happen, the Palace of Justice siege conducted by 19th of April movement murdered half of the judges and burn all files.</p><p>Escobar was responsible for the killing of so many people, and Colombia turned to be worlds murder capital where police and government officials were murdered every day. He was captured imprisoned in a luxurious prison known as La Catedral then shifted after a year to conventional jail where he escaped in 1992. after 16 months of the escape, Escobar died in 1993 in a shootout all in a bid to evade being captured by Search Bloc.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Escobar might have been a drug lord and a criminal, but to some people in Colombia, he was their savior. Pablo used to help the poor of Colombia, and he used to build houses for them, build football fields, sponsor children’s football teams, construct houses for them, and even distribute money to them. What Pablo did was just playing Robin Hood.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Pablo Escobar in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pablo-Escobar-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, Pablo Escobar’s net worth was estimated to be $30 billion.
