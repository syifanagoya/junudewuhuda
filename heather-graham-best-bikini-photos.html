I try to get a lot of sleep. Beyond that, I think just being happy on the inside and whatever. I do all the self-help stuff: I meditate, I do yoga, I work through all the stuff in therapy, then do all the different kinds of sorting through my inner world to make myself feel happy on the inside."</p><p id=e-qzH_xd-hk data-wc=38>Revealing just how much sleep she aims for each night, she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a> in 2016: "<strong>When I tell people how much I sleep sometimes, they are horrified.

She favors a triangle cup and high-leg bottoms that help to accentuate her features. Her most recent bikini photo was shared in August 2023 during a vacation in Greece. She looked phenomenal in a vivid red two-piece, which highlighted her slim physique and long, toned legs.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>2</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>5</span></p>&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/77311f03c35b-heather-graham-white-bikini.jpg><p id=eAFyYtFykUk1>During the same vacation, Heather modeled a white bikini while soaking up the sun on a pebble beach.

Basking under the hot sun, she chose another plain bikini, this time in black as she floated on the water in a giant pink flamingo.</p><p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>4</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>5</span></p>&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/43b0e42a9245-heather-graham-tiny-bikini.jpg><p id=eFmG72WCQ6_8>In January 2021, the actress temporarily switched up her love of plain colors for a bold leopard print bikini. She also opted for a balconette style which gave her more of a lift. With the sun shining down on her tanned skin, Heather once again looked sensational while enjoying some "ocean meditation".</p><p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>5</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>5</span></p>&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d0fcf8561308-heather-graham-bikini-photo.jpg><p id=eE7AIwNDobnB>&nbsp;In August 2020, she shared the above photo of herself in a green two-piece while chilling out on a beach after "a crazy year".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm660tMiopWiblaGyo77IrbBmq6SuuaZ7lGlnbXBkZLWmrdOhnKtll6euqa3MZpmeq6Rir6q3yKegZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
